1) "European Molecular Biology Laboratory" should be used instead of "EMBL"
2) "DÃ¼sternbrooker Weg 20" should be removed 
3) In equation 4, over the sum, the absolute brakets-like-symbols must replaced 
		by closest smallest integer. I.e. :

						|(l-k)/(g+1)| must be replaced by  | (l-k)/(g+1) |
																							 |_           _|
    It may not be so important since this float value can be interpreted as a 
	  limit of the sum.
