1) "European Molecular Biology Laboratory" should be used instead of "EMBL"
2) "DÃ¼sternbrooker Weg 20" should be removed
3) In equation 4, over the sum, the absolute brakets-like-symbols must replaced 
		by closest smallest integer. I.e. :

						|(l-k)/(g+1)| must be replaced by  | (l-k)/(g+1) |
																							 |_           _|
    It may not be so important since this float value can be interpreted as a
	  limit of the sum.

4) Include upgrades:
		*tandemGapMax. This option overcomes annotation errors in rows of tandem
			duplicates. And when this option is activated, pylDiag does not count
			small segmental tandem duplications as events that break the synteny.
			One advantage is that there won't be pralogs any more in small extracted 
			sbs, thus the previously impossible to calculate statistical validation 
			could be performed for sbs that had paralogs.
		*Weighted average
		*ancestral gene sign is also infered during the merging process of diagonals
		*explain the output file format, analog of genes.%s/list.bz2
